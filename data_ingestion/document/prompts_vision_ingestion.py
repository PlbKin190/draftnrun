PROMPT_DETERMINE_FILE_TYPE = """
You are a helpful assistant specializing in document analysis.

Your task is to determine the type of document based on the provided images of its pages.
Specifically, identify whether the document is:
- A *native PDF* (e.g., reports, manuals, text-heavy documents), or
- A *PowerPoint presentation converted to PDF* (often slide-based with design-heavy layouts).

**Guidelines:**
- If the pages are in **portrait orientation** and mostly **text-based**, it's likely a native PDF.
- If the pages (even in portrait) contain **colorful backgrounds,
large headings, or slide-like layouts**, it's likely a converted PowerPoint.
- Focus on visual presentation rather than file metadata.

**Important:**
- Set **only one** of the following to True:
  - `is_native_pdf`
  - `is_converted_from_powerpoint`

**Example Output:**
FileType(
    is_native_pdf=True,
    is_converted_from_powerpoint=False
)

PDF_TABLE_OF_CONTENT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are a helpful assistant specializing in extracting structured information from PDF documents.
Your task is to extract the **Table of Contents (ToC)** from the given
PDF document based on the provided images.

From these images, extract the **Table of Contents** with section titles
and their corresponding page numbers **exactly as they appear**.

---

**Instructions:**

1. **If a Table of Contents page is present:**
   - Extract only the content explicitly listed in the ToC.
   - Preserve the section numbering, casing, and punctuation **exactly** as shown.
   - Do **not** add, summarize, or infer additional sections.

2. **If no explicit Table of Contents is present:**
   - Reconstruct a ToC by analyzing document structure, including headings and layout.
   - Base section hierarchy on formatting cues like font size, boldness, indentation, or spacing.
   - Use the **page number of the document image** (not the number printed in the document).

---

**Formatting Requirements:**

- Represent the ToC using this structure:

Example 1 of output:

TableOfContent(
    sections=[
        Sections(title="# 1. Introduction", page_number=2, level=1),
        Sections(title="## 1.1 Background", page_number=3, level=2),
        Sections(title="### 1.1.1 Details", page_number=4, level=3),
        Sections(title="#### 1.1.1.1 First Event", page_number=4, level=4),
        Sections(title="#### 1.1.1.1 Second Event", page_number=5, level=4),
        Sections(title="# 2. Methodology", page_number=5, level=1),
        Sections(title="## 2.1 Data Collection", page_number=6, level=2),
        Sections(title="### 2.1.1 Surveys", page_number=7, level=3),
    ]

TableOfContent(
    sections=[
        Sections(title="# I. INTRODUCTION", page_number=2, level=1),
        Sections(title="## A BACKGROUND", page_number=3, level=2),
        Sections(title="### a Details", page_number=4, level=3),
        Sections(title="### b First Event", page_number=4, level=3),
        Sections(title="# II. METHODOLOGY", page_number=5, level=1),
        Sections(title="## A DATA COLLECTION", page_number=6, level=2),
        Sections(title="### a Surveys", page_number=7, level=3),
        Sections(title="## B CONCLUSION", page_number=8, level=2),
    ]
